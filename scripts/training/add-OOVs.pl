# Inserts an OOV tag above singleton nodes, using a modified
# definition of "singleton" in which a singleton is defined to be any
# word occuring the minumum number of times any word occurred.  Works
# by taking a stream of Treebank-style parse trees on STDIN, together
# with a lexicon (which contains vocabulary counts).  Writes the
# modified trees to STDOUT.

# Usage:
# cat TREES | add-OOVs.pl LEXICON > TREES.OOV
