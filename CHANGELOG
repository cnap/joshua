3.2 (development, "devel" branch)
=================================

- Pruning can now be specified with a single parameter "pop-limit",
  which limits the number of pops from the cube pruning candidate list
  (at the span level).  This replaces the beam and threshold pruning
  that was governed by four parameters (fuzz1, fuzz2,
  relative_threshold, and max_n_rules), whose performance and
  interaction was somewhat difficult to characterize.  The pop-limit
  allows a simple relationship between decoding time and model score
  to be defined.  

  Setting "pop-limit" in the configuration file or from the command
  line turns off beam-and-threshold pruning, and its use is
  recommended.

- Lots of reorganization and pruning

  - removed discriminative code


3.1 (stable, "master" branch)
=============================

- Fixed multithreading.  Use -threads N from the command line or
  configuration file to spawn N parallel decoding threads.

- Configuration file parameters can now be overridden from the command
  line.  The format is

  -parameter value

  Among these must be the configuration file itself, which can be
  referred to with -config, or -c for short.

3.0
===

- Added the highly parameterizable Hadoop-based Thrax grammar
  extractor, which extracts both Hiero and SAMT grammars.

- Incorporated a black-box pipeline script at
  $JOSHUA/scripts/training/pipeline.pl

- Moved development to github.com.
